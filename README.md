# Production-LLM-Agent-Group-Project
A group project to develop an LLM Agent to write in a personal style drawing from style examples and news articles. This project is meant to use state of the art components that can scale.

This project draws heavily from Decoding ML's Twin project: https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course/tree/main
